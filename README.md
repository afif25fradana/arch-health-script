A collection of health check and diagnostic reporting scripts for major Linux families. This toolkit is designed to be fast, safe, and provide clear, actionable insights into your system's condition.

Currently supported systems:
* **Arch Linux** & derivatives (EndeavourOS, Manjaro, etc.)
* **Debian/Ubuntu** & derivatives (Linux Mint, Pop!_OS, etc.)

## ‚ú® Key Features (Common to All Scripts)

* **Comprehensive Checks**: Analyzes Kernel, Hardware, Drivers, Packages, Services, and system logs.
* **Fast Parallel Execution**: Runs checks simultaneously in a safe, isolated manner to provide reports quickly.
* **Weighted Health Score**: Gives a 0-100 score with intelligent weighting for different types of issues.
* **Multi-Format Reports**: Automatically generates reports in `.log` (colorized), `.md` (Markdown), and `.html` formats.
* **Smart Dependency Handling**: Detects missing tools and suggests an installation command without crashing the script.
* **Safe by Design**: Never runs `sudo` commands automatically, ensuring user control and system security.
